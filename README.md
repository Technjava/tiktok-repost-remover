# Tiktok Repost Remover using Puppeteer and Node.js
### JavaScript & TypeScript

Hi! I'm a 16-year-old developer, and today I have completed a little project to remove each of your reposts one by one. If you like my project, feel free to leave a star. I did it on my own, and it was very difficult to understand each error encountered.

## Setup

- Setting this up is very simple. You just need to install Node.js at https://nodejs.org/, download a zip of this project and extract it, or download it using Git.

- ### Download:
  - If you are not familiar with GitHub, to download a resource you need to:
    - Click on 'Code',
    - Download Zip,
    - Unzip the folder using your favorite unzipper,
    - Go into this folder to continue (it may have dist in it).

- ### Git:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Technjava/tiktok-repost-remover.git
```

- ### Once it's done, you need to install all dependencies, for that do:
```shell
npm i
```

## Launch

### Once everything above is done, you can run the script by running:

```shell
node dist/app/index.js
`` or
```shell
npm run-script run
```

There is no interface; everything is on your command line.
# Thanks you!
